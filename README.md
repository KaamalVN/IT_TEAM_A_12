**ABSTRACT**

The objective of this project is to introduce the "Reimbursement App," a comprehensive web application developed to revolutionize the reimbursement process within organizations. The primary goal of this application, built using React.js, Node.js, and SQL, is to simplify and streamline the often complex and time-consuming process of reimbursing employees for expenses, including travel and broadband costs. The Reimbursement App addresses the challenges associated with traditional reimbursement systems by providing a user-friendly and efficient platform. It automates and digitizes the workflow, reducing the administrative burden on companies and ensuring that employees receive their reimbursements promptly. Key features of the Reimbursement App include an intuitive user interface that facilitates easy submission of reimbursement requests, real-time tracking to keep employees and administrators informed throughout the process, and the ability to customize the application to align with specific company policies. It leverages the power of SQL for data integrity and security, enabling comprehensive reporting and auditing capabilities. By implementing the Reimbursement App, organizations can optimize their reimbursement processes, freeing up valuable time and resources for HR and finance teams to focus on strategic tasks. Employees benefit from a modernized and efficient system that enhances job satisfaction and productivity.
